# watermark diffusion
- [x] StegaStamp training code (coco only)
- [ ] Imagenet Diffusion (progressing, the code has not been finished yet)
* 2024-6-19 Successfully ran the pipeline of fine-tuning ImageNet Diffusion. 
* 2024-6-20 Fixed bugs. Finished the modification to the model architecture, and the model loading pipeline. The last step is to integrate the StegaStamp Decoder into the overall pipeline.
- [ ] Tracing Code (progressing)
- [ ] Stable Diffusion


Due to the limited disk quota, the current training process is primarily conducted on the COCO and ImageNet validation set.
It's expected to take 3-4 days to implement the ImageNet Diffusion.
